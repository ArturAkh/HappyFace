# ChangeLog for HappyFace

* HappyFace_CE_v3.0 (add date once we release)

  # Bugfix: a leading ./ added to download path
    Author: Gregor Vollmer
    In some usecases a leading ./ was added to the file-path
    of an downloaded file, causing HappyFace to fail if an
    absolute path to the temporary is used.

  # Code Cleanup: Removed system-calls and used python-functions instead
    Author: Gregor Vollmer
    In several places system-calls were used to create directories
    and move files, which is bad style and a potential security risk.
    These were removed and replaced by functions from the Python
    shutil and os packages.

  # Code Cleanup: Use conventional Magic-Line
    Author: Gregor Vollmer
    Some script tools used a magic-line to start the python interpreter
    that did not match the proposed method. I changed it to use the
    standard env-tool.
