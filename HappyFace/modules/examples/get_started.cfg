[setup]

# every module must have 5 pre-defined variables:
# mod_title, mod_type , weight , definition, instruction

# mod_type can be "rated" and "plots" (defines the status symbol(s) depending on the status)
# see therefore ./HappyFace/output/web/ModuleStatusSymbolLogic.py

# weight (can be used by the category algorithms)
# see therefore ./HappyFace/output/web/CategoryStatusLogic.py

# the variables definition and instruction are strings which should filed with
# module specific information for the shifter

# css specifies if a css sheet for this module should be used (default = yes)
# in that case: "get_started.css" would be the appropriate css file for this
# module.

mod_title	=	Get Started
mod_type	=	rated
weight		=	1.0
definition	=	definition of the test logic
instruction	=	what to do


# addtional values can be also implented
# there is also the possibility to create *.local files
# in that case: "get_started.local" where each variabe can be overwritten
