HappyFace implements many classes and functions for internal use or for external tools.

.. note::
    Many of these classes are of **limited to no use** for the average **module developer and site maintainer**. If you want to get started with module development, please consult
    the module development guide. It links to this reference where the module developer needs to interact with core classes.
